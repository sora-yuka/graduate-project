        "description": "You’re reading The Django Book, first published in December 2007 (and updated in 2009) by Apress as The Definitive Guide to Django: Web Development Done Right.\r\n\r\nWe’ve released this book freely for a couple of reasons. First, we love Django and we want it to be as accessible as possible. Many programmers learn their craft from well-written technical material, so we set out to create a top-notch guide and reference to Django.\r\n\r\nSecond, it turns out that writing books about technology is fundamentally difficult: your words are often outdated before the book even reaches the printer. On the web, however, “the ink is never dry” — we can (and will!) keep the book updated.",
